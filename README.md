# Phase Reconstruction



Comparison of different Phase reconstruction algorithms for a digital holographic microscopy platform. Real-time reimplementation of one of these algorithms will be included in the following weeks.



## Technologies



The different compared algorithms are first implemented in Matlab.


Real-time implementation will be done in C++ CUDA for an Nvidia Jetson computing device.
